var int = 1; // to get an interger use int as avariable
var myAge = 31; // My age

console.log("Silly counting program for Extra Credit"); // trying out
while (int <= myAge/2) {
    
    console.log(int);
    process.exit();

}

// I used w3schools to look for the var int to use for interger. was not sure if my answer is correct.
